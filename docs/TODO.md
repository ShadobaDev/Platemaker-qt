# Platemaker GUI — TODO

Roadmap grouped by **which semver position a change forces**, not by priority or by the order
work happens in.

**How to read this**
- Version numbers are provisional, non-binding hints — a *kind of bump*, not a schedule.
- A section is the **minimum bump the change forces**. The GUI is post-1.0, so plain semver: a
  new backward-compatible **feature** bumps the **MINOR**; a **fix, cosmetic change or internal
  refactor** that does not change behaviour bumps the **PATCH**; only something that **strands the
  user** — e.g. a workspace format an older build cannot open — bumps the **MAJOR**.
- **Lib gate.** The GUI's contract is to its user, but the *timing* of some items depends on a
  libplatemaker version. The bucket states the user-facing impact; the item body says which lib
  version unblocks it.
- **Cascade.** Whichever section releases first takes its slot; the rest re-derive from the new
  baseline.

Baseline: **1.4.1 released (2026-08-16), 1.4.2 in progress** (`CMakeLists.txt`). 1.4.0 (2026-08-07)
added the *New from this…* project action, render-log persistence, the render summary and the restyled
progress bar. 1.4.1 is a patch — the DLL search-path hardening, the drag-and-drop fix, `Platemaker.exe`
version metadata, and a bump to **libplatemaker 0.4.1** (metadata-only) so the bundled DLL also carries
identity metadata. The next patch bucket is **1.4.2**; the next feature bucket re-derives to **1.5.0**.

---

## PATCH — next: 1.4.2

Bug fixes, cosmetics and internal cleanups — no new capability, no change to an existing workflow.

- [x] **Harden against DLL injection / hijacking (Windows) — search-path half done in 1.4.1.** Prompted
  by finding third-party global hooks injected into our own process during the drag-and-drop debugging
  (LG OnScreen Control's `ScreenSplitterHook`; ASUS/ENE RGB software) — plus general defence-in-depth for
  an unsigned app. Two Windows-only mitigations were considered; **one shipped, one is deferred** (full
  rationale in `docs/SPECIFICATION.md` §9):
  - **DONE (1.4.1) — restrict the DLL search path** to the app dir + System32 (removes the current dir
    and `PATH` — the classic DLL-planting vector; relevant because we bundle a large DLL graph). Called as
    the first statement in `main()`, guarded by `#ifdef _WIN32`, resolved dynamically so it no-ops on
    pre-Win8. Verified: launches + full render clean under Qt Creator and the installed build.
    ```c
    SetDefaultDllDirectories(LOAD_LIBRARY_SEARCH_APPLICATION_DIR | LOAD_LIBRARY_SEARCH_SYSTEM32);
    ```
  - **DEFERRED — block legacy extension points** (`ProcessExtensionPointDisablePolicy`). This is the half
    that would actually stop the hook injection we observed (plus `AppInit_DLLs` and legacy IME DLLs), but
    it also breaks **legacy IMM32 IMEs** and some **accessibility / assistive tools**. Broken IME would
    hurt non-Latin input (Korean / Japanese / Chinese authors — a core webtoon audience), and we have no
    CJK IME test rig to validate it (modern TSF IMEs are usually unaffected; legacy ones are not). The
    benign, low real-world risk of hook injection does not justify that regression. **Revisit once code
    signing lands or an IME test rig exists.** Deferred snippet kept for the record:
    ```c
    PROCESS_MITIGATION_EXTENSION_POINT_DISABLE_POLICY p = {0};
    p.DisableExtensionPoints = 1;
    SetProcessMitigationPolicy(ProcessExtensionPointDisablePolicy, &p, sizeof(p));
    ```
  - Neither is a substitute for code signing (the real integrity / reputation fix); the shipped half is
    defence-in-depth against search-order hijacking and does **not** affect SmartScreen.

- [~] **Pre-flight sanitize off the UI thread — won't do (by design).** `project.sanitize()` hashes
  every input + output on the main thread before launching, which can briefly pause the UI on a very
  large project. Decision after review: **leave it on the UI thread.**
  - The pre-flight hash is small next to the render that immediately follows and re-reads every input
    anyway; the user has already committed to a wait by pressing Render.
  - `sanitize()` **mutates** the live, UI-thread-owned model (the render worker runs on *value copies*,
    not the live model), so off-threading it means sanitize-on-a-copy + merge-back — real complexity and
    race surface for a pause this small.
  - Reacting to *config* changes does **not** need this: `sanitize()` really does two things — a cheap
    in-memory config-staleness pass (`detectCanvasConfigChange` / `detectInputCompositionChange`) and the
    expensive disk hashing. Config edits don't change file bytes, so they never need the hash. The
    output-profile axis is already surfaced live and cheaply via `outputsConfigStale()` on every
    `populate()`; the canvas-profile / reorder axes are caught at the next Refresh/render (only a minor
    tile-freshness lag — never a wrong render, since pre-flight re-derives full-vs-partial).
  - **Deferred option** if that tile-freshness lag ever matters: extract the cheap in-memory axes out of
    `sanitize()` into a `refreshConfigStaleness()` and call *only that* on config-change signals — no
    hashing, no threads. Not worth doing now.

- [~] **`MainWindow::m_savedSnapshot` — keep as-is (by design).** Original question: store a sha256
  instead of the full serialized string, and is it even useful. After analysis: **keep the full string.**
  - It is the **authoritative** unsaved-changes baseline: `isWorkspaceModified()` re-serializes the
    workspace and compares against it, and `maybeSave()` uses that — deliberately independent of the
    eager `m_dirty` flag so a forgotten `setDirty()` can never silently drop changes.
  - **Not made redundant by undo/redo.** The `QUndoStack`s revert edits, but not every change goes
    through undo (a render updates hashes via `setDirty(true)` but is never recorded; add/remove project
    is not undoable), so `QUndoStack::isClean()` would miss real modifications. Serialize-and-compare
    catches every serialized change — strictly more robust.
  - **sha256 rejected:** `isWorkspaceModified()` already re-serializes the whole workspace each call
    (that is the cost); a hash would not cut it, only shrink the stored baseline from ~KB to 32 bytes
    (negligible), and would foreclose a cheap in-memory **"Revert to last saved"** the full string
    enables (deferred idea, not built).
  - Separate minor smell noted for later: the title-bar `*` (driven by `m_dirty`) can be a false
    positive after undoing back to the saved state; harmless because the save prompt uses the
    authoritative check.


- [ ] **ImageTile** rework to be more eye-appealing

- [x] **Grey out the Auto-sort rules group until it works** — the `groupBoxAutosort` fields
  (`lineEditInputNameRegex` / `Prepended` / `Appended`, `pushButtonAutosortApply`) were fully
  interactive but wired to nothing, inviting input that does nothing. Done: the group is now disabled
  and its fields show a "Coming soon" placeholder (`project.cpp`, constructor). A stopgap — remove it
  when the Auto-sort feature lands (see the MINOR item).

---

## MINOR — next: 1.5.0

New, backward-compatible features. Several are gated on a lib version, noted in the item body.
(The `[x]` items below shipped in 1.3.0 / 1.4.0; the open ones re-derive to the next MINOR.)

- [x] **Drag files / folders onto the Project window** — Done. Dropping images (or a folder) onto the
  Input-tab tile list adds them via the same path as *Add files* / *Add from directory*
  (`addInputPaths()` → `mergeFileScan()`), as one undo step. Implemented as an event filter on the
  list viewport (`project.cpp` `eventFilter`/`addDroppedUrls`), so external file drops are handled
  while the list's InternalMove reorder drag still works. A dropped folder is scanned like
  *Add from directory* (non-recursive, image extensions) and remembered as the project's
  `inputDirectory`. A new capability (not a change to an existing workflow), hence MINOR.


- [ ] **Auto-sort rules** (`groupBoxAutosort`) — pattern/regex-based ordering:
  `lineEditInputNameRegex` body token (e.g. `chap_<num>` → chap_001, chap_002…),
  `lineEditPrependedRegex` (e.g. `title_<num>` first), `lineEditAppendedRegex`
  (e.g. `end_<num>` last); `pushButtonAutosortApply` applies. Complex token/regex
  parsing — dedicated future task. When implemented, **re-enable the group and drop the
  "Coming soon" stopgap** in `project.cpp` (see the completed PATCH item).

- [ ] **Output size estimation / limits (UI)** — show estimated avg/max slice size
  and total batch size, and warn on platform caps (Webtoon ≤ 2 MB/slice,
  ≤ 25 MB/chapter). Estimate computed by the lib (mirrored in lib TODO); GUI
  displays before render and/or reports after.

- [ ] **Project-wide colour correction.** Comic/webtoon art is drawn on iPad in **Display P3** (wide
  gamut); most webtoon platforms and screens are **sRGB**, so even Procreate's "sRGB IEC61966-2.1" export
  doesn't fully fix how colours land (gamut mapping / a perceived shift). Artists want the *whole chapter*
  graded consistently, not tweaked page-by-page. Idea: a **project-level colour tool** that uniformly
  adjusts every input page of a project at render time (non-destructive — source files untouched).
  - Open design questions: proper **ICC colour management** (P3→sRGB via embedded/assumed profiles)
    versus a simple **user-driven curves/levels** control (per-channel RGB curves, saturation,
    brightness/contrast) versus both; how the settings are stored (a project setting, like the canvas /
    output profile) and previewed before a full render.
  - The pixel work belongs in the lib (libvips has `vips_icc_transform` plus curve/LUT ops) — mirror in
    the lib TODO.
  - **Scope idea:** apply project-wide but with per-page **exclusions** (e.g. everywhere except the first
    and last page), which touches several GUI components (input tiles, a settings panel, the render
    path).

- [ ] **OS-level crash handler for hard faults (segfault / SEH) — DEFERRED, likely not worth it yet.**
  Verdict from the cost/benefit analysis (`PlateMaker/temp/crash-handling-options.md`, §0): a minidump /
  Breakpad apparatus is a **bazooka** for a simple app with a small user base. It only pays off for
  crashes on **users' machines we cannot reproduce** — which we don't yet have evidence of; a crash we
  observe ourselves (see the segfault in the PATCH bucket) is reproducible, so the **Qt Creator debugger
  on the Debug build gives a full trace for free**. The symbol worry is also smaller than it seemed: we'd
  archive only **libplatemaker's** small `-g` debug info (never Qt's GB-scale symbols, never libvips'
  which don't exist), and that covers the boundary frame in *our* code — the only frame triage usually
  needs; Qt/vips show as `module+offset+version`, which is enough. **Revisit only if unreproducible field
  crashes appear**; then do the *minimal* form (Windows `SetUnhandledExceptionFilter` → text breadcrumb +
  optional `MiniDumpNormal`), not Breakpad. Full menu + pitfalls in the linked note.

- [ ] **Auto-save** on pipeline finish (optional setting)

- [ ] **App looks flat/colorless on Linux vs Windows** — no explicit style is set in `main.cpp`, so Qt
  falls back to native per-platform styling: Windows gets `windows11`/`windowsvista` (dark-mode aware,
  styled GroupBox borders, accent colors); Linux falls back to a much plainer default. (We deliberately
  keep the native windows11 look on Windows — see the light-mode fix — rather than force Fusion, so this
  cross-platform-consistency item is still open.) If uniformity matters, consider
  `QApplication::setStyle("Fusion")` plus a shared custom `QPalette`/QSS, accepting that it trades the
  native windows11 look for consistency.

---

## MAJOR — next: 2.0.0

Nothing pending. Reserved for a change that strands the user — e.g. a workspace format an older
version cannot open. The format has stayed additive and reads both ways, so no such change is on
the horizon.

---

## To establish / test — no release impact

Investigations, testing and manual/wiki work that ships no code change on their own.

- [ ] **Decide the recommended output format and quality** — the manual currently lists PNG /
  JPEG / WebP neutrally because there is no considered recommendation to give. Users need one
  ("use X unless Y"). Needs a comparison on real pages: file size and visible quality for flat
  line art versus painted work, at a few JPEG quality values, against the platform's per-chapter
  size cap. The first published chapter used JPEG purely to fit 20 MB per chapter, which is a
  constraint rather than a considered choice. Feeds `Manual-Output-Profiles`.


## Add dependency manifest — done (SBOM submission)

- [x] **Repository defines its dependencies for GitHub's Dependency graph.** GitHub can't read our CMake
  dependencies (find_package for Qt/libplatemaker, the prebuilt libvips zip, FetchContent), and it does
  **not** ingest an SBOM merely committed to the repo (the *Export SBOM* button only exports). So instead
  of a fake `package.json`, we feed the graph through the **Dependency Submission API**: a committed SPDX
  snapshot at [`sbom/sbom.spdx.json`](../sbom/sbom.spdx.json) (the superset: Qt, libplatemaker, libvips,
  nlohmann/json) is submitted by
  [`.github/workflows/dependency-submission.yml`](../.github/workflows/dependency-submission.yml) on every
  push touching `sbom/`. Regenerate the snapshot from the build's `credits/sbom.spdx.json` when a version
  changes (see `sbom/README.md`). CVE alerts additionally need *Dependabot alerts* enabled in
  Settings → Code security; [`.github/dependabot.yml`](../.github/dependabot.yml) separately keeps the
  GitHub Actions current (Dependabot version-updates has no C++ ecosystem for Qt/libvips).

## Distribution & installer trust (no paid signing) — no release impact

Windows SmartScreen warns on our installer because it is **unsigned**. Only a paid Authenticode
certificate removes that warning — OV ≈ 200-400 USD/yr (still needs SmartScreen reputation to build up),
EV ≈ 300-700 USD/yr (instant reputation), or Azure Trusted Signing ≈ 10 USD/mo (cheapest legit,
needs a 3-yr-old org or individual verification). A self-signed cert does **not** help — Windows
doesn't trust it. **Decision: don't pay.** The items below instead give users a *verifiable* integrity
and provenance trail; they do **not** remove the SmartScreen warning (set that expectation in docs).

- [ ] **Submit to winget (`winget-pkgs`)** — free community channel giving users a trusted
  `winget install Platemaker` path; the manifest validates the installer's SHA-256. Cleaner than a raw
  `.exe` download (doesn't remove SmartScreen on direct download, but the winget flow is smoother).
  Consider a Scoop bucket too for the dev audience.

- [x] **VirusTotal report** — `Platemaker-1.3.0-Setup.exe` scanned **0 / 68 clean**
  ([report](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/6d1b95c6dc68d94c9d7a8b4ea7a7c41f2135538d3ea4ab1bade091551cae7602)),
  linked from the README. Per-build (tied to the file hash), so rescan each release; could later be
  automated in the release CI via the VirusTotal API.
