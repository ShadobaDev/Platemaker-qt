# Changelog

## [1.0.1] — 2026-07-18

Requires **libplatemaker 0.2.0** — the minimum is now enforced at configure time instead of
surfacing as compile errors.

### Added

- **Batch render — "Refresh all projects" (F6)** — sweeps the workspace one project at a
  time, skipping the ones already up to date, and reports a summary of rendered / skipped /
  failed. Config changes are confirmed once for the whole sweep, not per project
- **Out-of-sync warning on workspace open** — explains, in one dialog, why tiles are amber
  and offers to refresh straight away
- **About dialog** — component table listing version and licence for Platemaker,
  libplatemaker, Qt, libvips and nlohmann/json

### Changed

- Output tiles update **live** as each slice is written, instead of only after the render
  finished
- Render log records each project's outcome (finished / cancelled / failed with the reason),
  so a batch leaves a readable trail rather than transient status text

### Fixed

- **Cancelling a render no longer discards the slices it already wrote** — they were on disk
  but the project did not record them, so the next render redid the work
- **Canvas profile edits are now visible** — pages whose profile changed are marked amber
  ("out of sync") instead of silently reporting as up to date
- **Output tiles no longer duplicate during a re-render** — each slice refreshed its own tile
  instead of appending a second one
- **`FetchContent` could not find the release** — the download succeeded; the failure was in
  the path handling afterwards, which aborted the configure as if the URL were wrong
- Empty band above the About text when the application icon fails to load
- `clazy` warning: range-loop over a non-const Qt container could detach it
