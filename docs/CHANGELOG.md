# Changelog

## [1.1.0] — 2026-07-20

A **minor** release, not a patch: it adds features — batch render, an About dialog, workspace
repair notices — none of which break an existing workflow.

Requires **libplatemaker 0.2.1** — the minimum is now enforced at configure time instead of
surfacing as compile errors.

### Added

- **Batch render — "Refresh all projects" (F6)** — sweeps the workspace one project at a
  time, skipping the ones already up to date, and reports a summary of rendered / skipped /
  failed. Config changes are confirmed once for the whole sweep, not per project
- **Out-of-sync warning on workspace open** — explains, in one dialog, why tiles are amber
  and offers to refresh straight away
- **About dialog** — component table listing version and licence for Platemaker,
  libplatemaker, Qt, libvips and nlohmann/json
- **Workspace repair notice** — when two profiles are found sharing an internal
  identifier, one is given a new one and a dialog explains what changed and why some
  projects may now need a refresh
- **Output profile presets are marked and read-only** — "Webtoon Standard" is labelled
  *(preset)* in Manage output profiles, with Edit and Delete disabled. A preset is shared
  by every workspace, so it has to mean the same thing everywhere; Duplicate makes an
  ordinary copy you can change freely

### Changed

- Output tiles update **live** as each slice is written, instead of only after the render
  finished
- Render log records each project's outcome (finished / cancelled / failed with the reason),
  so a batch leaves a readable trail rather than transient status text

### Fixed

- **Cancelling a render no longer discards the slices it already wrote** — they were on disk
  but the project did not record them, so the next render redid the work
- **Projects under a path with non-ASCII characters now work** (fixed in libplatemaker
  0.2.1). Two symptoms, one cause: inputs stayed amber after a successful render, so every
  render redid all the work and overwrote the output; and a workspace could be saved but not
  reopened — which looked like a Google Drive restriction, because Drive creates a localised
  folder name such as the Polish "Mój dysk"
- **A canvas profile could not be assigned to a project** — profiles created together in
  one pass of the manage dialog were given the same internal identifier, which made all
  but the first count as "already assigned" and disappear from the assign list. Identifiers
  are now random and checked for uniqueness, and existing workspaces are repaired on open
- **New workspaces no longer define "Webtoon Standard" themselves** — the profile was
  described here *and* in the CLI, matching only by coincidence. Both now take it from
  libplatemaker, so a workspace created in either place is identical
- **Canvas profile edits are now visible** — pages whose profile changed are marked amber
  ("out of sync") instead of silently reporting as up to date
- **Output tiles no longer duplicate during a re-render** — each slice refreshed its own tile
  instead of appending a second one
- **`FetchContent` could not find the release** — the download succeeded; the failure was in
  the path handling afterwards, which aborted the configure as if the URL were wrong
- Empty band above the About text when the application icon fails to load
- `clazy` warning: range-loop over a non-const Qt container could detach it
